        review: `'The Royals' follows the lives of a frictional british royal family, blending glamour, scandal, and intrigue. At the center of the story is  Queen Helena (played by Elizabeth Hurley), a cunning and image- conscious matriarch determined to preserve the monarchy's dignity amidst chaos. After the sudden death of the heir to the throne, Prince Robert, the monarchy is thrown into disarray.
       
His Younger brother, Prince Liam, unexpectedly becomes the next in line, and he struggles with the burden of royal expectations while also dealing with romantic entanglements and personal demons. His twin sister, Princess Eleanor, is a rebellious royal known for her wild lifestyle, constantly attracting tabloid attention.
      
Meanwhile, King Simon seeks to reform the monarchy and make it more transparent and democratic, but his ideals put him at odds with others  within the palaceâ€”including Helena and the manipulative Lord Chamberlain, Cyrus, who harbors ambitions of his own.
        
The show dives deep into palace conspiracies, secret romances, betrayal, and power plays, presenting a darker, sexier, and more tumultuous view of royalty.
